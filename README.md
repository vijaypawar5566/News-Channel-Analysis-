#  News-Channel-Analysis-
Data Analysing Using Youtube Video Data from Most Popular News Channels

## Aims and objectives
Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

1 . Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.
2 . Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:
3 . Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
4 . Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
5 . Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?


## Steps of the project
1 . Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for the top 10-15 channels in the data science niche (this includes several small steps: create a developer key, request   data and transform the responses into a usable data format)
2. Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis
3 . Exploratory data analysis
4 . Conclusions
